### Functional Patterns in Golang
# GOMAD (Early stage)
### This package is still in an early stage of development. Feel free to open a PR and contribute or just open an issue to help me priorities features.

Following is a list of future modules coming up in no specific order:

- [X] Maybe
- [ ] Either
- [ ] Result
- [ ] List
- [ ] Pipe
- [ ] HKT
- [ ] Monad
- [ ] IO
- [ ] Task
- [ ] Reader

### Prerequisites
All these modules use the newly added features of Golang v1.18 (Still in beta as of today) notably type and function generics.
